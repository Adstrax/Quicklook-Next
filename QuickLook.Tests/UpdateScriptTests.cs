/// <para>
/// It used to back the folder up with <c>xcopy /EXCLUDE:"&lt;file&gt;"</c>, and xcopy
/// cannot read an exclusion file whose path is quoted - the backup "failed", the
/// update aborted, and the package that had just been downloaded was thrown away.
/// That went unnoticed for several releases because a failed update only looked
/// like "the version number did not change". These tests pin the script to the
/// working copy mechanism and to the cleanup order that keeps %TEMP% from filling
/// up with one package per attempt.
