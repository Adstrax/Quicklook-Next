/// v3.42.0: prepares the preview families this user actually uses, in the
/// background, right after startup.
/// <para>
/// Measured on a warm app, the *second* preview of a family is always much faster
/// than the first: text 289 ms -> 96 ms, csv 205 -> 124, png 170 -> 100,
/// mp4 595 -> 413. The difference is one-time work - the plugin's panel XAML and
/// JIT, its native libraries, the WebView2 environment - that every user pays on
/// the first preview of that kind. This class pays it while the user is still
/// doing something else (the app starts at login), so the first preview feels like
/// the second one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It is usage-driven: the families come from <see cref="PluginUsageTracker"/>,
/// so a user who never opens a video never pays for the video pipeline. Video and
/// Office are deliberately left out - preparing them means starting playback or
/// synthesising a valid OOXML document, and their panels are already the cheapest
/// to reach (the shared WebView2 pool covers Markdown/HTML/Office).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Cost, measured on the tray process with nothing previewed: warming text and
/// image adds ~23 MB private / ~36 MB working set over a cold session; adding a
/// WebView2 family (Markdown/HTML) doubles that. The families are therefore capped
/// (<c>WarmUpFamilyCount</c>, default 2) and the whole thing can be switched off
/// with <c>WarmUpPreviewFamilies=false</c>.
